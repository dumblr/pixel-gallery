          <p>
            You probably ended up on this page because browser doesn't support
            the features needed to create your own pixel-gallery.
          </p>
          <p>
            pixel-gallery is built on a technology called <em>Dat</em>. Dat is a
            new p2p hypermedia protocol. It provides public-key-addressed file
            archives which can be synced securely and browsed on-demand. You can
            read more about Dat <a href="https://datproject.org/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Dat is only support in{' '}
            <a href="http://beakerbrowser.com">Beaker Browser</a>, though other
            browsers are considering support.
